The "needle" is the rocket that you control in the game. I should probably have named it "rocket" or something like that but the tiny cylinder being at the mercy of gravity and the vastness of space inspired the name needle for the rocket.

You control the rocket's engine by dragging the circle in the triangle downwards; the farther down, the more mass/second will be expelled by the engine. If you drag the circle left/right, the engine will tilt left/right, causing the rocket to rotate in addition to accelerating forward.

The gravitational constant is set to 1, i.e. ignored, so that gravity is noticable. And the masses of the planets are a lot (!) smaller than in real life.
